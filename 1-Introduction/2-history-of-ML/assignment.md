# Create a timeline

## Instructions

Using [this repo](https://github.com/Digital-Humanities-Toolkit/timeline-builder), create a timeline of some aspect of the history of algorithms, mathematics, statistics, AI, or ML, or a combination of these. You can focus on one person, one idea, or a long timespan of thought. Make sure to add multimedia elements.
